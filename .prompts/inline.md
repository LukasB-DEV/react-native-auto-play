### What to Comment On

- Critical bugs.
- Readability issues (unclear variable or function names, overly complex expressions).
- Simplifications improving maintainability (idiomatic use of slices, maps, `defer`, etc.).
- Obvious inefficiencies or redundancy (duplicate code, unnecessary checks).

### What to Ignore

- Minor stylistic issues.
- Missing comments or documentation.
- Micro-optimizations without clear value.
