## Getting Started

1.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

2.  **Run the app:**

    *   **iOS:**

        ```bash
        yarn ios
        ```

        You can test CarPlay with the iOS Simulator or with the CarPlay Simulator app, which is available as part of the "Additional Tools for Xcode". 

    *   **Android:**

        To run the app on Android Auto, you need to set up the Desktop Head Unit (DHU). For more information, see the [Android Developer documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/cars/testing/dhu).

        You also need to forward a port to the DHU. You can use the `adb_port_setup.sh` script located in the root of this project.

        ```bash
        ../../adb_port_setup.sh
        ```

        Then, you can run the app:

        ```bash
        yarn android
        ```
